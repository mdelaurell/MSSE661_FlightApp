The Airline Booking software system is a java based system to allow customer to view flights, create reservations based on flight segments, and managed their profile information. The system will allow a manager to view flights, perform operation to add/cancel/update flight information, generate a report and manage profile data. Customers will be required to register in the system with name, address, username and password, email address, as well as credit card information (optional), including a 16-digit card number and a 4-digit expiration date prior to accessing the system. The system will have a page for a traveler to log in with username and password. The system will be able to handle flight management, reservation and booking management for a variety of airlines and routes (departing from and arrival at) operations. The customer will be able to save, cancel reservations and booking from within the application. Managers must be able to add, cancel and update flights from the system. Managers must be generate an inventory report for the system. When adding a flight, the system must allow to enter an airline code, name, flight number, departure location, departure day of the week/time, arrival location, arrival day of the week/time, cost of business class and cost of economy class ticket. Specific fees may be added if a bike is turned in late, if there is a reservation change or there is a cancellation. Bike rental rates must be modifiable. Reservations may be changed or cancelled until 24 hours before the scheduled rental. The system must be able to generate reports.

All of the actors using the system will have a user interface to help perform any actions. Customers will have a general screen with access to functions that will allow them to browse flight selection using specific search criteria such as departure and arrival date/time and location, number of passengers, one-way or round trip. A list of flights will be presented to the customer with departure/arival and cost information. The display flight will be +/- a specified number of hours. They will be able to select up to two flight segments. Once they have completed their itinerary, they will have the option to reserve it, and once reserved the option to purchase creating a booking. A credit card will be necessary for the purchase of any booking. The customer will have the ability to cancel an itinerary from their itinerary list. cannot navigate out of the application while using the tablet. A bluetooth credit card reader can be paired with the tablet to allow the customers to swipe their credit cards to pay. Staff that sign into the system with their personal log-in information will have access to extra features that allow them to be notified when a reservation is made, allow them to record a bikes return time and record the physical state it is in. Managers will have a higher access level where they can use these same features, as well as more options including setting any extra fees to a customerâ€™s bill, adding or removing a bike from the available inventory, modifying any bike rental rates and generating reports that show inventory and rental history. These extra options will be available to them as well as any owners that sign into the system with their personal log-in details.
